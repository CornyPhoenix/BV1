	\subsection{Histogram and Noise}
	Histograms used to better understand how frequently or infrequently certain values occur in a given set of data. A greyvalue histogram of an image provides the frequency of greyvalues in the image. The histogram of an image with N quantization levels is represented by a 1D array with N elements. A greyvalue histogram describes discrete values.
	
	For an image showing white parsels on a black conveyor belt, I would expect clearly separated bimodality. In a histogram going from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest), one peak towards the 0 for the white parcels and the other one to the far side towards 255 for the black conveyor belt.
	
	If the camera is affected by sensor noise, this might change the histogram in that the two peaks cannot be clearly segregated, a valley occurs. The histogram appears to be somewhat blurred. It is difficult to determine a threshold by which we can decide whether the object in a scene is the parcel or the conveyor belt.
	
	\subsection{Projections}
	
	Create a projection of greyvalues in an image using column profile to get a column vector of all (normalized) row sums. The sum will be lower for rows showing parts of characters, while the lines going through will result in higher sums.
